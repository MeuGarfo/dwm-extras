dwm SLiM themes
===============

Introduction
------------
This package contains login themes for the SLiM login manager 
(http://slim.berlios.de/), intended for dwm fans (http://suckless.org/).

Four styles are available, each with a light and dark colour scheme.
Each theme dir includes the GIMP source file if modification is desired.


Requirements
------------
For proper viewing, these themes rely on the 'egdes' typeface (font),
from Artwiz (http://artwizaleczapka.sourceforge.net/).  These fonts 
may already be available from your distribution's repository.  

Arch Linux users can install them by running the following as root:

    # pacman -S artwiz-fonts

The fonts can also be installed manually, using the included tarball.


Installation
------------
Installation will depend upon your distribution; typically SLiM themes
are placed in '/usr/share/slim/themes/'

Once installed, activate a given theme by editing the SLiM config,
located at '/etc/slim.conf' for Arch Linux users. Change the value for 
'current_theme' to the name of the desired theme folder, for example:

    current_theme   dwm02
